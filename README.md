# Emotion Detection App

This is a Streamlit-based web application that detects emotions in faces from uploaded video files. It uses the `DeepFace` library for emotion analysis and `OpenCV` for video processing. The app processes each frame of the video, detects emotions, and displays them on the video. It also provides statistics about the emotions detected and allows the user to download the processed video.

## Features

- Upload video files in `.mp4` format.
- Emotion detection using DeepFace library (angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, neutral).
- Display of dominant emotions on the video.
- Statistics on detected emotions (average scores).
- Processed video available for download.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- `streamlit`
- `deepface`
- `opencv-python`
- `numpy`
- `PIL` (Pillow)
- `pandas`

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install streamlit deepface opencv-python numpy pillow pandas
```

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/emotion-detection-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

   ```bash
   cd emotion-detection-app
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app.

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. Open the app in your web browser, upload a video, and start detecting emotions.

## How It Works

1. **Upload Video**: Upload an `.mp4` video file through the app interface.
2. **Process Video**: The app processes each frame of the video to detect faces and their corresponding emotions using the DeepFace library.
3. **Emotion Analysis**: The emotions detected (angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, neutral) are displayed in real-time on the video, and emotion statistics are updated.
4. **Download Processed Video**: After processing the video, a download link will be provided for you to download the video with emotion annotations.

## Example Output

Once the video is uploaded and processed, the app will display each frame with the detected emotions. It will also show a table with average emotion scores calculated from the video.
